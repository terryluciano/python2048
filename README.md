# Python 2048

A simple implementation of the classic 2048 game built with Python and Tkinter.

## Description

This project is a desktop version of the popular 2048 puzzle game. It uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface.

## Requirements

-   [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (for dependency management and running the project)
-   Python 3.14 or higher (managed by uv)
-   Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd python2048
    ```
3. Run the game using `uv`:
    ```bash
    uv run main.py
    ```

## Controls

_(Note: Controls implementation is in progress)_

-   Use the arrow keys to move the tiles.
-   Combine tiles with the same number to reach 2048!

## Project Structure

-   `main.py`: The main entry point for the game.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration and dependencies.
